It turns out this is basically the best idea ever. I recruited my Bocoup colleague Rick Waldron to join me, and together we spent a whirlwind hour showing off robots powered by JavaScript to an endless stream of people walking up to our booth. Rick did a great job of setting up a demo that people could play with, and they took turns moving sliding potentiometers that controlled servos that moved an arm with a gripper at the end, trying to pick up Bocoup stickers. Ours was one of about a dozen booths showing off open-source projects, and the room was a wonderful madhouse."><meta name="twitter:creator" content="@rmurphey"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="Show &amp; Tell"/><meta name="twitter:site" content="@rmurphey"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"/><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico"/><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,400italic,300,800|Source+Code+Pro:400,700,300" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/8.9.1/styles/default.min.css"/><style>@media (max-width: 800px) {

<p>It turns out this is basically the best idea ever. I recruited my Bocoup colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/rwaldron">Rick Waldron</a> to join me, and together we spent a whirlwind hour showing off <a href="https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five">robots powered by JavaScript</a> to an endless stream of people walking up to our booth. Rick did a great job of setting up a demo that people could play with, and they took turns moving <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9119">sliding potentiometers</a> that controlled <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9064">servos</a> that moved an arm with a gripper at the end, trying to pick up Bocoup stickers. Ours was one of about a <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/open-source-science-fair-exhibitor-experiences/">dozen booths</a> showing off open-source projects, and the room was a wonderful madhouse.</p>
<p>After a break for dinner, I, <a href="http://twitter.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/holman">Zach Holman</a> each gave 20-minute talks, but the talks were really just icing on the evening. The &quot;science fair&quot; format promoted such <em>intentional interaction</em>, in a way that traditional conferences just can&#39;t, no matter how great the hall track or the parties may be. The format invited and encouraged attendees to talk to the presenters -- indeed, if they didn&#39;t talk to the presenters, there wasn&#39;t much else for them to do. By the time the official talks came around, a super-casual, super-conversational atmosphere had already been established, and the energy that created was tangibly different from any event I&#39;ve been to before.</p>
<p>I love conferences, and the sharing of knowledge that happens there, and there&#39;s a whole lot to be said for their speaker-audience format -- don&#39;t get me wrong. But I&#39;d also love to see more events figure out how to integrate this show and tell format. &quot;Booths&quot; don&#39;t need to mean &quot;vendors trying to sell things&quot; -- they can actually be a great opportunity to facilitate conversation, and to let open source contributors show off their hard work.</p></div><div class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_shortname = 'rmurphey';
