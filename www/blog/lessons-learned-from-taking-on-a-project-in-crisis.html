I developed the entire front-end -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- for a non-trivial application with a limited spec in just seven days. The experience was so eye-opening that I feel the need to write down some of the things I&#39;ve learned, in hopes that I can benefit from my experience in the future.


    Demand all technical source material up front, such as functional specs, mockups, work that&#39;s been done to date, etc. Give the client a fixed amount of time to deliver that source material, and don&#39;t make a decision about taking on the project until you&#39;ve seen it. What the client can deliver in that fixed amount of time will shed a lot of light on the state of the project and whether their expectations are realistic.
    Set clear time expectations. Am I willing to work 16 hours a day? Am I expected to? Are there hours during which I&#39;ll be expected to be available? Am I willing to work on the weekend?
    Find out whether the client expects me to be available after the imminent deadline, and to what extent. The last thing I want is to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by being unable to support the code I&#39;ve written.
    Do not accept responsibility for commitments made on my behalf. The recruiter said I&#39;d be available six hours a day when I told him four? Not my problem. The client committed to having a feature ready for review without consulting me? They probably won&#39;t make that mistake again.
    Ascertain the rest of the team&#39;s commitment to the project. If I&#39;m expected to work long hours, will they be there during those long hours to get me what I need? Are there any constraints on their availability?
    Establish a single point of contact at the client, and make clear I&#39;ll be depending on them to get me any information I need and I&#39;ll be treating their decisions as final. Insist that they participate in all calls I&#39;m expected to participate in.
    Limit the amount of work I do before I have access to all client systems I&#39;ll need access to: version control, testing environments, ticketing systems, etc.
    Insist on a ticketing system. I&#39;m new to the project and I have a lot to get up to speed on. I don&#39;t want emails flying at me from all directions -- decisions and technical requirements need to be documented in a single place that everyone can see. This is my only insurance when someone wants to know why something isn&#39;t done, or why it wasn&#39;t done the way they expected.
    Insist on version control, even if it&#39;s something crappy like CVS. I&#39;ll need a way to make sure the rest of the team has access to my latest and greatest. FTP blows, especially when I&#39;m FTPing to a server where another developer is constantly deploying a new build, overwriting my work.
