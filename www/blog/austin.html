I had just sold my car and left my two jobs as a bartender. Between the tips in my pocket and the money I&#39;d made from selling my car -- a 1996 Neon with a probably cracked head gasket -- I had about $2,000 to my name. I had a bicycle, camping gear, cooking gear, maps, a handheld GPS, a flip phone, two changes of bicycle clothing, and two changes of street clothes. I was in Camden, Maine, and my parents were taking my picture in front of a bicycle shop.


My destination was Austin. My plan was to ride to Savannah, GA -- via Boston, New York, and the eastern shore of Maryland -- and then turn right. I didn&#39;t really have much of a plan beyond that, except that I hoped to crash with a friend of a friend when I got to Austin. I heard they had a good bus system. I figured I could sort out a job before my money ran out.
Three weeks and 1,000 miles later, I found myself outside of New Bern, NC, more tan and more fit than I&#39;d ever been or would ever be again. I stopped at a grocery store and picked up food for the evening, tying a bag of apples off the side of my bike. I was planning to camp just south of town, but as I neared a park in the center of town, I  found myself surrounded by cyclists setting up camp. They were there for a fund-raising ride, and no, no one would mind if I camped in the park with them instead of riding another 10 miles."><meta name="twitter:creator" content="@rmurphey"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="Austin"/><meta name="twitter:site" content="@rmurphey"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"/><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico"/><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,400italic,300,800|Source+Code+Pro:400,700,300" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/8.9.1/styles/default.min.css"/><style>@media (max-width: 800px) {

<p>Three weeks and 1,000 miles later, I found myself outside of New Bern, NC, more tan and more fit than I&#39;d ever been or would ever be again. I stopped at a grocery store and picked up food for the evening, tying a bag of apples off the side of my bike. I was planning to camp just south of town, but as I neared a park in the center of town, I  found myself surrounded by cyclists setting up camp. They were there for a fund-raising ride, and no, no one would mind if I camped in the park with them instead of riding another 10 miles.</p>
<p>I pitched my tent. I followed them to the free dinner being served for them across the street.</p>
<p>I rode 150 miles -- unencumbered by camping gear and all the rest -- in the fund-raising ride for the next two days.</p>
<p>I made new friends. They invited me to come stay with them for a few days in Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>I lived with them for a month. I borrowed their 1990 Ford Festiva for a year.</p>
<p>I got a job painting a house. I got a job waitressing. I got a job doing desktop publishing. I got a job making web sites.</p>
<p>I got good at JavaScript. I traveled the world talking about it.</p>
<p>I met a girl. We bought a house. We adopted a baby.</p>
<p>I never made it to Austin, though life has taken me there a few days at a time more times than I can count. Finally, in 2013, I even got a job there. Since February, I&#39;ve made the trek enough times that it&#39;s truly become a home away from home. I&#39;ve stopped using my phone to find my way around. Waitresses recognize me. People tell me about the secret back way to work, but I already know it. I have opinions about breakfast tacos.</p>
<p>It&#39;s time to finish the story I started more than a decade ago, which brings me to the point: With much love for Durham, and for the irreplaceable people who have made our lives so full here, we&#39;re moving to Austin this spring. At last.</p></div><div class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() {
