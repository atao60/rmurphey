<p>I&#39;ve found it incredibly pleasant to work with designers who have demonstrated knowledge and skill when it comes to CSS and HTML -- at my last job, our lead designer was also the guy you went to if you were stumped by a CSS issue. Knowing the tools means that production considerations become an active part of the design process: you don&#39;t create an element without giving some thought to how it will be built. In the best of worlds, you weigh the cost of building the element -- in time, in HTTP requests, in excessive markup -- against the benefit of having it on the site, and make educated decisions about what is &quot;worth it.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never found Photoshop to be an adequate tool for mocking up a design -- it just doesn&#39;t &quot;think&quot; the way the web does, it just doesn&#39;t observe the constraints that the web imposes, and it just doesn&#39;t make accessible the parts of CSS that are truly powerful.</p>
<p>While I am no designer, I play one sometimes for freelance clients. When I haven&#39;t wanted to go straight to code, I&#39;ve found that another Adobe product, InDesign, can be incredibly powerful. It&#39;s an application intended for print layout (and some of its related assumptions can be a little frustrating, such as its lack of a hex-based color picker/setter), but generally it is exponentially closer to the realities of the web than Photoshop. It thinks in boxes, not pixels, and offers paragraph-, character- and object-level stylesheets that can ... cascade! Just like with CSS, you can rapidly and dramatically alter the appearance of a page once you establish the base, semantic elements of it. It steers you to think about a page&#39;s structure, not just its presentation.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping that the number of web designers who think that Photoshop is a sufficient tool will dwindle, but I&#39;m not sure what the route is to get to that point. Photoshop&#39;s inadequacy in this regard is so clear to me -- and to people like the 37signals folks -- that I&#39;m not sure how you persuade someone who still believes otherwise.</p><p class="follow">Posted 6-Jun 2008.</p></div><div class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_shortname = 'rmurphey';
