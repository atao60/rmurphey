<p>Which is to say: My hands seem a bit fuller than they did back when I started office hours, so for now, it&#39;s time to hit the pause button while I focus on my new team. If you&#39;re interested in picking up where I left off, hit me up and I&#39;m happy to spread the word.</p><p class="follow">Posted 4-Aug 2015.</p></div><div class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_shortname = 'rmurphey';
