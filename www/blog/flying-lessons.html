I was doing some freelance work, but still feeling entirely uncertain about my ability to make a living. I decided to do what any marginally employed person might do: spend about $7,000 taking lessons to become a private pilot.</p>
<p>I have had a lifelong fascination with flying, and I&#39;d taken lessons in gliders when I was a kid -- every four hours of helping at the airfield got me one 15-minute lesson. If you don&#39;t know about gliders, they&#39;re just airplanes except without an engine. On the up side, that means your engine can&#39;t fail; on the down side, if you mess up when you&#39;re trying to land, you don&#39;t exactly get a second chance. That whole landing thing always terrified me, and I was off to college before I ever managed to &quot;solo.&quot;</p>
<p>A little more than 13 years later, I found myself in a Cessna 152 rolling down a 3,200-foot grass runway just outside of Durham, N.C., the 100-foot trees at the end of the runway growing ever-closer in the windshield until a dial on the instrument panel said we were going 55 knots -- which is basically like 55 miles per hour, but when you say knots you sound like a pilot (or a sailor, I guess) -- and the instructor said it was time to pull back on the yoke, ever so gently. And the plane lifted off the runway and the windshield was filled with more sky than ground and the trees passed below me and I was flying.</p>
<p>The FAA says you can get your license after just [40 hours of flying][ppl], plus a little bit of ground instruction, and on that October day I was sure I&#39;d knock it out in 45 hours, tops. I&#39;d been flying flight simulators since I was like six years old, when -- no joke -- I loaded the program off a cassette player. When I was a kid I went to the airport in my hometown to score expired navigational charts. Plus I had flown gliders, and plus, I was smart. How hard could it be?</p>
<p>You know how they say flying is safer than driving? You&#39;re pretty safe on that plane that you took to get here -- like, hundreds of times safer than in a car -- but it turns out that little planes flown by private pilots crash all the time. Pilots leave the gas caps unscrewed and all the fuel gets sucked out and they don&#39;t even notice until the engine sputters and dies. They overload their plane on a hot day and don&#39;t quite clear those trees at the end of that runway. They fly into weather for which their skills are no match, and end up running into a mountain -- euphemistically referred to as CFIT, or &quot;controlled flight into terrain.&quot;</p>
<p>Lots of private pilots are shining examples of the Dunning-Kruger effect: unskilled and unaware of it, much like myself in those first few lessons. A typical private pilot has fewer than [100 hours][nyt] of flying time --  airline pilots have thousands or even tens of thousands -- but they have that piece of plastic that says they can fly a plane, and gosh darnit, they are going to fly a plane.</p>
<p>It would eventually take me six months and more than 60 hours to get my license, and by the end I was in no rush. In one of many sleepless nights during my training, I came to realize a thing: learning to fly wasn&#39;t just about learning to take off and land and get from point A to point B. Barring infinite money and infinite time, it was about learning how to be permanently new at a thing that could kill me if I screwed it up.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been six years since I rolled down that runway, and six years later, it occurs to me that there are a whole lot of parallels between that experience and my life as a developer. I remember showing up to the inaugural JSConf in 2009, feeling pretty secure in my standing as a bit of a jQuery badass, and being promptly blown away by just how large the JavaScript world actually was, even in 2009. I felt intimidated and overwhelmed and, I won&#39;t lie, a bit embarrassed at how little I actually knew and understood. Over time, though, I&#39;ve realized: this is just the permanent state of things. I&#39;d better get used to it.</p>
<p>This, then, is a talk about how to be new at a thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>not about learning new things, about <em>being new at a thing</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Aviate, Navigate, Communicate</h2><ul>
<li>translation: know your priorities</li>
<li>flying: nowhere to pull over</li>
<li>priorites when flying: 1) do not die, 2) get where you&#39;re going</li>
<li>priorities at a new job: balance learning with project delivery.</li>
<li>study, ask, do</li>
<li>on my team, we try to be explicit about this with new folks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>All Available Information</h2><ul>
<li>FAR §91.103</li>
<li>flying: <em>you</em> are responsible for not dying. you&#39;re expected to know about the weather, the airport you&#39;re flying to, the route you&#39;re taking, your aircraft&#39;s limitations, your own limitations, etc. the FAA will occasionally do &quot;ramp checks&quot; to make sure you&#39;ve done your due diligence.</li>
<li>ultimately, this is all about not making assumptions. just because it&#39;s sunny out doesn&#39;t mean it will be in a couple of hours. just because you flew to an airport on a half tank of fuel last time doesn&#39;t mean it will work out the same way today, when there&#39;s a 40-knot headwind.</li>
<li>&quot;all available information&quot; is somewhat preposterous on its face these days; the amount of information available to us is unreal. i think of this more as a challenge: what information could i get that i haven&#39;t gotten? could it possibly be useful?</li>
<li>&quot;all available information&quot; means being diligent and methodical about gathering facts before making a decision. this is a lot slower than making decisions based on assumptions. later, when you&#39;re not new, you can make decisions based on assumptions -- we might call that instinct. but not when you&#39;re new.</li>
<li>when i was hired at bv, they brought me on to improve the organization and maintainability of a project&#39;s codebase. i didn&#39;t just read the code and get to work tearing it apart; i interviewed every developer on the team to find out where their pain points were, and learned that certain parts of the code, while terrible, weren&#39;t worth spending time on.</li>
<li>what information could you get that you haven&#39;t gotten? could it possibly be useful?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Climb, Communicate, Confess, Comply</h2><ul>
<li>sometimes we get lost. it&#39;s ok!</li>
<li>step 1 is to realize you&#39;re lost</li>
<li>step 2 is to explain what&#39;s wrong</li>
<li>step 3 is to ask for help</li>
<li><p>step 4 is to <em>do what they say</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>i think a lot of people are reluctant to ask for help because they&#39;re afraid of how people will respond when it becomes clear they don&#39;t know everything. of course they don&#39;t know everything, they are new! i think also though that people don&#39;t know how to ask for help. in my experience, people are actually incredibly willing to help -- as long as you&#39;ve done your due diligence. this means you&#39;ve read the docs, done your google due diligence, read the surrounding code, explored the problem with debugging tools, and produced a reduced test case that demonstrates your problem.</p>
</li>
<li>developing the skills to make a good request for help is essential to being good at being new at a thing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Checklist</h2><h2>The Go-Around</h2><ul>
<li>sometimes, despite our best efforts, we need to start over</li>
<li><p>this isn&#39;t exceptional -- it&#39;s an entirely normal maneuver</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your code is not a reflection of you. It isn’t a reflection of your beliefs, your upbringing, or your ability to be a good person. Your code is [...] a reflection of your thinking process at the time that you wrote it. - @rockbot</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trust Your Instruments</h2><ul>
<li>translation: learn how to tell what&#39;s going on when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</li>
