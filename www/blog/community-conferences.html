200 people buy tickets, we had speakers like Douglas Crockford, Paul Irish, and

In May, O&#39;Reilly Media is holding another JavaScript conference in San

$100,000 for top-tier sponsorships, and that they are offering a 10-minute
keynote as part of the package.
This turned my stomach, and not just because I believe it cheapens the
experience of attendees, who will pay hundreds of dollars themselves. What
really upset me was that a few weeks ago, I was approached to be on the speaker
selection committee of FluentConf, and that conversation led me to discover
that FluentConf would not be paying for speaker travel and accommodations. And
so the other day, I tweeted:

<p>In May, O&#39;Reilly Media is holding another JavaScript conference in San
Francisco, called FluentConf. I recently came to know that they are charging
$100,000 for top-tier sponsorships, and that they are offering a 10-minute
keynote as part of the package.</p>
<p>This turned my stomach, and not just because I believe it cheapens the
experience of attendees, who will pay hundreds of dollars themselves. What
really upset me was that a few weeks ago, I was approached to be on the speaker
selection committee of FluentConf, and that conversation led me to discover
that FluentConf would not be paying for speaker travel and accommodations. And
so the other day, I tweeted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>conference #protip: save your money -- and your speaking skills -- for events that don&#39;t sell their keynotes for $100k</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last night, I was at the Ginger Man in Austin, and I checked the Twitters,
discovering that Peter Cooper, one of the chairs of FluentConf, had replied to
a conversation that arose from that tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@rmurphey @tomdale If you&#39;re referring to Fluent, that is news to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will accept the weird fact that the co-chair of a conference didn&#39;t know its
speaking slots were for sale -- I gather that it is essentially a volunteer
role, and the co-chairs aren&#39;t necessarily in the driver&#39;s seat when it comes
to decisions like this. I let Peter know that, indeed, I had a PDF that
outlined all the sponsorship options.</p>
<p>This is the part where, in some alternate reality, a mutual understanding of
the offensiveness of this fact would have been achieved. What happened instead
was a whole lot of name-calling, misquoting, and general weirdness.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the deal. Conferences can run their event however they want, and they
can make money hand over fist. They can even claim they are the giving
JavaScript developers &quot;an event of their own,&quot; ignoring the existence of
the actual community-run JavaScript events that have been around for years now.  I
probably won&#39;t go to or speak at an event that makes money hand over fist, but
I don&#39;t have any problem with the existence of such events, or with people&#39;s
involvement with them.  However, when a conference is making money hand over
fist -- my back of the napkin calculations would suggest that FluentConf stands
to have revenues of well over a million dollars -- then that conference has no
excuse not to pay the relatively paltry costs associated with speaker travel
and accommodations.</p>
<p>A conference does not exist without its speakers. Those who speak at an event
-- the good ones, anyway -- spend countless hours preparing and rehearsing, and
they are away from home and work for days. While I do not discount the benefits
that accrue to good speakers, the costs of being a speaker are non-trivial --
and that&#39;s <em>before</em> you get into the dollar costs of travel and accommodations.</p>
<p>When an event is unwilling to cover even those hard costs -- nevermind the
preparation time and time away from work and home -- it materially affects the
selection of speakers.  It&#39;s even worse when those same conferences claim to
desire <a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2012/public/content/about#diversity">diversity</a>;
the people they claim to want so badly are the very people most likely to be
discouraged when they find out they have to pay their own way to the stage.</p>
<p>In the conversation last night, I made this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when only the people who can afford to speak can speak, then only the people who can afford to speak will
speak.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amy Hoy responded with a criticism of community-run conferences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and when only ppl who can order a ticket in 3 seconds can afford to come, only ppl who can order a ticket in 3 seconds can come</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that getting tickets to the actual community-run events is hard, but
that is because the community-run events flat-out ignore the economics of
supply and demand, choosing instead to sell tickets at affordable prices even
if it means they will sell out in a heartbeat, leaving a boatload of potential
profit on the table. And yet those events -- JSConf, TXJS, and the like -- have
still figured out how to cover speaker costs and provide attendees and sponsors
with unforgettable experiences.</p>
<p>When an event with revenues exceeding a million dollars is unwilling to cover
those costs, while simultaneously selling speaking slots, I do not hesitate for
a moment to call that event out, and I do not hesitate to call
on <a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2012/public/content/about#commitee">respected members of the community</a> to sever
their ties with the event. I&#39;m not embarrassed about it, and you can call me all
the names you want.</p></div><div class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() {
