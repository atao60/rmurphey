I had a whim a few weeks ago to organize the camp; I envisioned an unstructured day where fellow jQuery developers could get together and talk about how they use the library. I figured that since the jQuery Conference had sold out and had a huge waiting list, getting a couple dozen people together on a Saturday in Durham, N.C. wouldn&#39;t be that hard.
We had around 25 people show up to the camp today, from novices to experts, including Scott Gonzalez, a contributor to the jQuery UI library. True to my (utter lack of) vision, it was a very unstructured day, but productive and fun I think. My only experience with unconferences was at BarCamp RDU just a few weeks ago, so it took me a bit to get into full go-with-the-flow mode, but when I didn&#39;t know what to do, I just asked &quot;what do I do now?&quot; and usually someone would tell me.
We started out by writing some topic ideas up on the wall, and quickly had enough to get started. I split off with the novices to give an intro to the library, while the main room dug into the topics that had been suggested, starting with a talk by Scott about stateful plugins. Up next was Brian Landau from Viget, showing off the code for his mapping plugin and giving an overview of ScrewUnit; then, David Eisinger, also of Viget, showed us some simple strategies for improving perceived performance."><meta name="twitter:creator" content="@rmurphey"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="Inaugural North Carolina jQuery Camp"/><meta name="twitter:site" content="@rmurphey"/><meta name="twitter:image:src" content="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-vejw/tdlezEdCedqyrontDHsHFjxtjJkAaCpctfsJlbCJAcHbaGJGqyEEeFwgspop/media_httpfarm3static_bjtwC.jpg.scaled500.jpg"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico"/><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,400italic,300,800|Source+Code+Pro:400,700,300" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/8.9.1/styles/default.min.css"/><style>@media (max-width: 800px) {

<p>Lunch -- made possible by the generosity of Rich Orris, FireStream Media, Ignite Social Media, and DesignHammer -- was time for informal conversations and demonstrations. Here&#39;s Scott and someone whose name I don&#39;t remember doing some quality whiteboarding:</p>

<p>We came back from lunch with a reprise of my presentation from the jQuery Conference about using objects to organize your code, minus FAST FORWARD but otherwise largely intact. I was grateful to have more than 30 minutes this time, and we ended up having some good conversation about code organization in general.</p>
<p>From there it was on to some great show-and-tell -- people are doing excellent things with the library, and doing them with ease -- and then Scott wrapped up the day with an overview of jQuery UI. Probably the biggest hit of the day was Scott&#39;s &quot;just one more thing ...&quot; moment, when he showed us a whole new API for using the position method as a setter, coming soon to a plugin near you. Lots of oohs and aahs about that one.</p>
<p>I said at the end of the day that this first camp was really just a proof of concept -- yes, I can get 25 people to show up to talk about jQuery. I&#39;m hoping to do another jQuery camp in January, perhaps. There are a few things I&#39;d like to do differently next time. For one, I&#39;d like to be a little bit more intentional about having more than one session that&#39;s suitable for beginners -- a lot of the presentations were super-interesting, but way over the heads of people just getting started.</p>
<p>Also, there were a number of people who signed up who didn&#39;t make it, which is a shame because I ordered food expecting a larger turnout. I&#39;d asked people to let me know if they couldn&#39;t make it, but alas only a handful did. Next time, I think I&#39;ll charge a token amount to attend -- say $10 or so -- so people will feel a bit more committed. If they don&#39;t make it, at least their food will be paid for! Charging a few dollars will also help reduce the need for sponsors -- not that I don&#39;t love the sponsors, just that it was a bit of work and stress to line them up.</p>
<p>Finally, next time I&#39;d like to be a little bit more intentional about setting up and promoting the event. This time around, I started promoting it before I even had a venue, and shortly after I secured a venue (thank you Viget!) all the slots were filled. Next time around, I might approach that a little bit differently, especially if I can line up a few different venue options.</p>
