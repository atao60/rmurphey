Other libraries solved the same questions but those solutions felt ugly and clunky and goshdarnit, <em>hard</em>, and I give jQuery the utmost credit for making JavaScript suck so much less when all I wanted to do was show or hide or slide a thing or load some content onto my page.

Heck, I&#39;ll even grant that &quot;enterprises&quot; aren&#39;t off their rockers to use it -- for the things it was meant to be used for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What upsets me is when smart people seem to say that jQuery&#39;s victory in an internet-wide popularity contest suggests, well, anything at all when it comes to more complex needs. It upsets me because my clients hear those suggestions, look at that same well-marketed graph, and I am left explaining to them that, yes, jQuery is popular, but it&#39;s popular because it answers a small set of questions easily and well -- even for people who don&#39;t even know JavaScript! -- and you, dear client, have vastly larger questions than that.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, these toolkit decisions ought to be about more than a popularity contest; jQuery may be the right answer, or part of the right answer, but it&#39;s imperative, to me, that my clients understand the scope of the question first. It&#39;s imperative that they make their decisions based on a full understanding of pros and cons, risk and reward, cost and benefit -- not based on a graph, not based on a popularity contest.</p>
<p>So again I say: we, as a community, and especially the influential ones among us, do well when we elevate the conversation beyond that contest and acknowledge that choosing the right toolkit depends on first understanding what you&#39;re choosing the toolkit for. We do well when we educate teams and decisionmakers on the lessons we&#39;ve learned in the time since DOM, Ajax, and events were the big question of the day, on the best practices that have emerged, on the situations where we&#39;ve, gasp, had to look beyond jQuery -- either to other tools or other toolkits -- for the answers. And we do well when we start showing them how they can do the same.</p>
<p><em>An aside: Some people I like a lot have pointed out that in the midst of all of my complaining, I have not come out and offered a solution. This is fair. Two things: One, I have not wanted this conversation to collapse into Dojo vs. jQuery vs. YUI vs. Ext vs. MooTools vs. whatever, because if it does, I think we&#39;ve missed the crux of the matter: that different tools do different things, that some set out to answer complex questions and some do not. If anyone has been unclear, which I rather doubt, my personal preference of late has been to use Dojo. I do not recommend using Dojo for everything under the sun, but I find it offers a lot of utility when writing non-trivial applications. I cannot make a compelling argument for using it vs. YUI, simply because I don&#39;t know YUI well enough. I can&#39;t even make a compelling argument for using it vs. Ext, except for licensing issues that may or may not be relevant in a given scenario. Two, if you&#39;re disappointed that I haven&#39;t offered a solution, especially a jQuery-based one, I apologize. However, I feel there are too many viable existing solutions out there already, and I haven&#39;t come up with a good reason to promote a jQuery-based solution besides jQuery&#39;s popularity. And, well, see above for my thoughts on that.</em></p></div><div class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() {
